The Chinook Record Store signed a deal with a new record label, and the task is selecting the first three albums that will be added to the store, from a list of four. All four albums are by artists that don't have any tracks in the store right now - we have the artist names, and the genre of music they produce:

|Artist Name |	Genre |
|-----|-----|
|Regal| Hip-Hop|
|Red Tone| Punk|
|Meteor and the Girls|Pop |
|Slim Jim Bites |Blues |

The Chinook database is provided as a SQLite database file called chinook.db. The database can be represented as the scheme below:
